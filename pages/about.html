	<h1>About TodoToday</h1>
	<p><a href="http://hromnik.com">I</a> needed an application which whould show me
	all my tasks and tasks which I should do today. <br>I also needed history of work
	(what I have been doing what day), times of tasks and total times of my work.</p>
	<p>I am looking for partner(s) which would help me improve and propagate this app.
	<br>

	<h2>TodoToday is open souced from 12.11.2013</h2>
	<p>I wanted to do this app commercial, but it's impossible without a good team.</p>
	<p>
		One day <a href="https://twitter.com/markusgattol" target="_blank">@markusgattol</a> wrote me that
		he likes TodoToday and asked if i could open source it.
		<br/>
		I had to think about it and i have decided to make it opensource.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you can contact me and together we can make the best TODO
		application ever!
